      <p>Ayurveda, the ancient "science of life," is built upon the foundation of the three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These are the fundamental bio-energies that govern our physical and mental processes. Understanding your unique doshic constitution, or Prakriti, is the first step toward achieving holistic wellness.</p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Vata (Air & Ether)</h3>
      <p>Vata governs all movement in the body, from breathing and blood circulation to the firing of neurons. People with a dominant Vata dosha are often creative, energetic, and lively. When out of balance, they may experience anxiety, dry skin, and digestive issues like gas and bloating.</p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Pitta (Fire & Water)</h3>
      <p>Pitta controls digestion, metabolism, and transformation. Pitta-dominant individuals are typically intelligent, focused, and driven. An imbalanced Pitta can lead to irritability, inflammation, skin rashes, and heartburn.</p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Kapha (Earth & Water)</h3>
      <p>Kapha provides structure, stability, and lubrication to the body. Those with a strong Kapha nature are calm, compassionate, and loyal. When Kapha is in excess, it can manifest as weight gain, congestion, and a lack of motivation.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Knowing your Prakriti allows you to make lifestyle and dietary choices that promote balance and prevent disease. Our in-app questionnaire is a great place to start your journey of self-discovery!</p>

      <p>In Ayurveda, the concept of Agni, or digestive fire, is paramount to our overall health. A strong Agni means efficient digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients. Conversely, a weak or imbalanced Agni leads to the formation of "Ama" â€“ toxic, undigested food matter that is the root cause of most diseases.</p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Signs of Healthy Agni:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
        <li>Good appetite and easy digestion</li>
        <li>Regular, well-formed bowel movements</li>
        <li>Clarity of mind and high energy levels</li>
        <li>Healthy glow and clear skin</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Tips to Strengthen Your Agni:</h3>
       <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
        <li>Eat only when you are truly hungry.</li>
        <li>Avoid ice-cold drinks, especially with meals.</li>
        <li>Sip warm water or ginger tea throughout the day.</li>
        <li>Eat your largest meal at midday when the sun (and your digestive fire) is strongest.</li>
        <li>Incorporate digestive spices like ginger, cumin, coriander, and fennel into your cooking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Nurturing your Agni is one of the most powerful things you can do for your long-term health and vitality.</p>

       <p>Aligning our daily activities with the natural rhythms of the day is a cornerstone of Ayurvedic wellness. This practice, known as Dinacharya, creates balance, harmony, and discipline in our lives.</p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">A Simple Morning Routine (Dinacharya):</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
        <li><strong>Wake Before Sunrise:</strong> This is the Vata time of day, full of fresh, pure energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Tongue Scraping:</strong> Remove Ama (toxins) that have accumulated overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil Pulling:</strong> Swish with sesame or coconut oil for oral health.</li>
        <li><strong>Drink Warm Water:</strong> Hydrate your tissues and stimulate a bowel movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Abhyanga (Self-Massage):</strong> Massage your body with warm oil to nourish the skin and calm the nerves.</li>
        <li><strong>Yoga & Meditation:</strong> Gentle movement and mindfulness to prepare for the day.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Even incorporating one or two of these practices can have a profound impact on your energy, mood, and overall well-being. Start small and build a routine that feels nourishing for you.</p>
